    <p>Living in the 21st century we know that our life revolved around computers and cell phones. And also as today junk food referring to different restaurants  from different places with the customizing interior and taste ,people love to explore these places .That’s why we choose to build up an website  which will provide every single information from the known restaurant from Dhaka with elgible features that will make life  easier for the food lovers . </br> </br>Till today there are no website in Bangladesh which has the accurate rating of the foods along with the  service of food delivery system around the whole city . We wish to create a Website that will not only have the best food delivery system but also will have single and authentic rating system for every unique item .
This system will lessen the time consumption for choosing the desired item and place as everything is neatly sorted in here and with the heavy traffic its often hassle to pick up a place and eat but with our delivery system ,we believe to deliver the best service and the most desirable  interface. </br> </br>With the burning traffic and the tread of lifestyle inversely puts a question mark on the system functionality but we believe we are going to create a website that will solve the time issue but will satisfy the taste buds of the customers . As much as dynamic the Project will be ,it will also sort out the fake review restaurants problems and manage the quality of the food.
